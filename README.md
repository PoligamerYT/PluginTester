# PluginTester
This is a simple program made in C# that helps you test your plugin in different versions of the Game (1.0.0-1.20), creating servers in a specific Version and Server Type (Paper, Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge, Purpur, Pufferfish, Pufferfish+, Pufferfish+ Purpur) of your selection.

## How to use
When you open the program for the first time it will generate two folders Plugins that is where you are going to put your plugin, and dependencies, or if need plugin config like a normal plugins folder, and Servers that is where the servers are going to be created. Then you will select a Version and Server Type, and if you want or need you can change the Java Arguments (Don't Change "Java" and "Jar"), and when you are ready click Test, and the program will create the server
automatically! (If you want to add or remove a plugin for the server you need to click Delete Plugins Folder)
